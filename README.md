# 🎼 Musical Notation Compiler

A domain-specific language (DSL) compiler for musical notation, built with **Flex**, **Bison**, and **C++**. It parses and analyzes structured music notation and generates audio output in `.wav` format. Future releases aim to include sheet music export via **LilyPond**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Custom lexer and parser for music notation
- ✅ Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) construction
- ✅ Semantic validation of musical structure
- ✅ Named section declaration and referencing
- ✅ Time signature nesting and validation
- ✅ Audio generation using **FluidSynth** (`Melodia.wav`)
- ⏳ [WIP] Export to LilyPond `.ly` format for sheet music rendering

## 🧱 Language Components

### 🔹 Notes and Alterations
- **Notes**: `A` to `G` (Anglo-Saxon notation)
- **Octaves**: `1` to `8` (e.g., `C4`, `G5`)
- **Alterations**: `#` (sharp), `b` (flat)
- **Dotted notes**: e.g., `C5 q.` increases duration by 50%
- **Rests**: `- q`, `- h`, `- w`, etc.

### 🔹 Duration Symbols
- `w`: Whole note (4 beats)
- `h`: Half note (2 beats)
- `q`: Quarter note (1 beat)
- `e`: Eighth note (0.5 beats)
- `s`: Sixteenth note (0.25 beats)

### 🔹 Separators
- `,`: separates notes within a measure ➔ handled by `NotesSequence`
- `|`: separates different measures ➔ handled by `MeasureSequence`

### 🔹 Time Signature
```text
time 4/4 {
  C4 q, D4 q, E4 q, F4 q |
  G4 h, A4 q, G4 q;
}
```
Defines beats per measure and beat duration.

### 🔹 Repeat Blocks
```text
repeat 2 {
  A4 q, B4 q, C5 q, D5 q
}
```
Repeats the block `n` times.

### 🔹 Section Declaration and Reference
```text
section intro {
  E5 e, F5 e, G5 e, A5 e;
}

intro
```
Reusable sections for modular composition.

## 🌳 AST Overview

Main AST Classes:
- `StatementSequence`: chains multiple statements
- `Note`: represents individual notes with pitch, duration, and modifiers
- `NotesSequence`: comma-separated list of notes/rests
- `MeasureSequence`: pipe-separated measures
- `Time`: defines a time signature block
- `RepeatDeclaration`: defines repeat blocks
- `SectionDeclaration` & `SectionReference`: manage reusable blocks

---

## 🤍 Semantic Rules

- `time` blocks must contain measures matching the defined duration
- Notes/rests must not exceed 4.0 beats (in 4/4 context)
- Repeated/referenced sections must comply with time constraints
- Sections must be declared before being referenced

---

## 🔊 Audio Generation

Using **FluidSynth** and **libsndfile**, the compiler converts parsed music to audio.

- Notes ➔ MIDI values (C1 to C8, with sharps/flats)
- Rests ➔ zeroed audio buffers

### Output:
```
Melodia.wav
```

## ⚙️ Installation (WSL/Linux)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bison flex libfluidsynth-dev libsndfile1-dev
```

### 📦 Additional Setup

To support audio generation, download the required **SoundFont (.sf2)** files using **Git LFS**:

```bash
# 1. Install Git LFS
sudo apt install git-lfs

# 2. Configure Git LFS
git lfs install

# 3. Download large files (SoundFonts)
git lfs pull
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
make
./bin/RhythmCode examples/paraElisa.rc 
```

If parsing and analysis succeed, the file `Melodia.wav` will be generated.
